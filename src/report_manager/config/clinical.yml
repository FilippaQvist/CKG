        description: '# Principal Component Analysis

                        **Principal component analysis (PCA)** is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations 
                        of possibly correlated variables (entities each of which takes on various numerical values) into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated 
                        variables called principal components. This transformation is defined in such a way that the first principal component has the largest possible variance 
                        (that is, accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible), and each succeeding component in turn has the highest variance possible under 
                        the constraint that it is orthogonal to the preceding components. The resulting vectors (each being a linear combination of the variables and containing n observations) 
                        are an uncorrelated orthogonal basis set. PCA is sensitive to the relative scaling of the original variables. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis)'
