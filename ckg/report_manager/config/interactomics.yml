        description: '# Principal Component Analysis

                         **Principal component analysis (PCA)** is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations 
                         of possibly correlated variables (entities each of which takes on various numerical values) into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated 
                         variables called principal components. This transformation is defined in such a way that the first principal component has the largest possible variance 
                         (that is, accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible), and each succeeding component in turn has the highest variance possible under 
                         the constraint that it is orthogonal to the preceding components. The resulting vectors (each being a linear combination of the variables and containing n observations) 
                         are an uncorrelated orthogonal basis set. PCA is sensitive to the relative scaling of the original variables. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis)'

                        **Analysis of variance (ANOVA)** is a collection of statistical models and their associated estimation procedures (such as the "variation" among and between groups) 
                        used to analyze the differences among group means in a sample. ANOVA was developed by statistician and evolutionary biologist Ronald Fisher. The ANOVA is based on the law of 
                        total variance, where the observed variance in a particular variable is partitioned into components attributable to different sources of variation. In its simplest form, 
                        ANOVA provides a statistical test of whether two or more population means are equal, and therefore generalizes the t-test beyond two means.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance)'
