Plasma proteome profiling discovers novel proteins associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease

**Description**

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects 25% of the population and can progress to cirrhosis, where treatment options are limited. As the liver secrets most of the blood plasma proteins its diseases should affect the plasma proteome. Plasma proteome profiling on 48 patients with cirrhosis or NAFLD with normal glucose tolerance or diabetes, revealed 8 significantly changing (ALDOB, APOM, LGALS3BP, PIGR, VTN, IGHD, FCGBP and AFM), two of which are already linked to liver disease. Polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (PIGR) was significantly elevated in both cohorts with a 2.7-fold expression change in NAFLD and 4-fold change in cirrhosis and was further validated in mouse models. Furthermore, a global correlation map of clinical and proteomic data strongly associated DPP4, ANPEP, TGFBI, PIGR, and APOE to NAFLD and cirrhosis. DPP4 is a known drug target in diabetes. ANPEP and TGFBI are of interest because of their potential role in extracellular matrix remodeling in fibrosis.
