Installing Neo4j
===================

Getting started with Neo4j is easy.

First download a copy of the Neo4j desktop version from the `Neo4j download page <https://neo4j.com/download/>`__.
The Community Edition of the software is free but a sign up is required.
Once the file has downloaded, you can install Neo4j by following the instructions automatically opened in the browser.
